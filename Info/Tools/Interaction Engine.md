## Interaction Engine

What separates Proprium from regular meta-data is each structure is linked to a specific type of data visualization of interactivity. The Proprium-Js module, reads Proprium that has been assigned to a given GLTF model.  It then generates either data visualizations, or user interface elements for interacting with the smart contract that is associated with the Proprium.
