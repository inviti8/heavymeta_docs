## Blender Addon


Complex data structures are required in to facilitate complex interactions with virtual objects.  Ultimately, these complex data structures will need to adhere to certain standards.  Tools are needed to make simpler for creators to design and assign data to their virtual creations.   Our Blender Addon allows creators to simply assign a variety of Proprium data to 3D creations.  This Proprium data is embedded directly into the exported GLTF model file, by way of a custom GLTF extension.
