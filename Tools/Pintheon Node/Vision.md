### The Problem
Today's internet forces creators to choose between reach and control. Centralized platforms own your audience, monetize your data, and use your content to train AI—all while keeping most of the profits.

### The Solution
Pintheon puts creators back in control. Run your own secure node to store and share content directly with your audience. No middlemen, no hidden costs, and no fine print.

### How It Works
1. **Self-Hosted Power**: Your files stay on your hardware
2. **Ledger-Verified**: Immutable proof of ownership for every creation
3. **Global Reach**: Share content directly with your audience, anywhere

### Join the Movement
Be part of the next internet revolution where creators own their work, their audience, and their future. The tools are here—take back what's yours.
