Under the current Web 2.0 model, creators upload content to corporations who offer hosting of said files, for a plethora of reasons.  Because of these services are 'free', profits must be made utilizing user data, therefore the files and data collected on these centralized services are subject to exploitation, to the determent of the user in most cases.  Artificial Intelligence Corporations have taken advantage of this to train their models from data posted on the public internet.

A Pintheon node is at it's core a self hosted private ipfs file server.  IPFS, is a decentralized file storage and distribution technology, under which every file is stored using it's unique hash, or finger print. This node can be exposed to the internet, using tunneling services such as Pinggy.  In this way, all files can be made available, self hosted to the open internet.  This ipfs file server runs inside of a container, and all files that are uploaded to it, exist on the host machine.  In this way, you do truly OWN the files you upload. Every file is uniquely identifiable by it's immutable hash.  Pintheon has built functionality that enables you to mint the file data to a token, that includes the file hash, and the node address.  This further cements ownership of the file.

These nodes are meant to lay a foundation for a new paradigm on the internet.  No more giving up privacy and ownership rights to centralized corporations.  Using decentralized ledger technology, Artists and Creators can take back complete autonomy over their digital work. If we establish immutable records of ownership, it follows we will be able to establish legal frameworks that protect the work of Artists and Creators. The objective envisioned for this network is to provide a digital stronghold for Artists and Creators. The goal being that the coming generations can seal and maintain ownership of their digital creations, and leverage AI as they see fit as individuals or network wide. So that they may benefit from the fruits of their labors.
