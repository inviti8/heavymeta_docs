Each file list item can expanded to reveal the available Stellar Ledger functions associated with it. Clicking the 'Publish' button will create a Smart Contract event call, that will publish the file information to the Stellar Ledger.

Clicking the 'Tokenize' button allows you to create a token associated with the file.  An initial allocation can be set, which is the amount of this file token that will be minted to the node wallet.  This file token can be transferred to any Stellar compatible wallet, and the associated contract holds the metadata for the particular file.
