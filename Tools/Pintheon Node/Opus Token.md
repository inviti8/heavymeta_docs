## Opus Token
<img src="/.vitepress/_resources/opus11.png" alt="opus11.png" width="199" height="199" class="jop-noMdConv">

By running a Pintheon Node, you become a part of the network.  Currently Pintheon Nodes run on the Stellar Network, each node supporting transactions in XLM as a payment token, as well as the native token Opus.  Opus, is meant to act as a small incentive for running a node.  A predetermined amount of Opus is minted to the Pintheon Node wallet, every time a file is uploaded to the node.

1.  Only Pintheon Nodes are capable of minting Opus.
2.  The Mint Reward is predetermined and can be adjusted via network voting
3.  Nodes may be invalidated, if they are found to be spamming the network with useless data.
4.  On mint reward, the treasury also collects a predetermined reward of Opus to it's wallet.

There is potential that Opus could become a speculative asset, though this may not be it's use case.  The network participants will ultimately shape it's use case and direction.
