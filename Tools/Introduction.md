## Introduction

Heavymeta aims to be a catalyst in building content and decentralized applications for Web 3.0.  It is a tool set that empowers digital content creators to harness the power of decentralized technology and smart contracts.  Let's be honest, to this point what we call Web3, isn't really anything new functionally.  Many project tout ownership of digital content, but in actuality, they offer only digital certificates for content, not addressing content storage.

If you have to pay a service to serve your files, on their computers, how do you truly own the content?  Heavymeta bridges this disconnect, offering a complete tool set for digital ownership. Running a Pintheon node also protects your content from censorship, as ultimately it's on your own machine, so it can only be removed by you.

Building web3 content using these Web2 technologies is a antithetical.  After all, shouldn't you own what you create?  Shouldn't you have full control of your creation? Heavymeta can help you with that.
