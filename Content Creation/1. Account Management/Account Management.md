## Account Management

It's a good idea to start out by creating account for your content creation work.  The tools will work without this step, as a default account is available by default, still it's recommended to create an account.

In the desktop environment, the hvym daemon provides necessary interfaces for account creation.  When the Heavymeta tool set is installed the daemon is started, and setup in your environment as a program that runs on system start up.  

The daemon icon should be visible in the system tray:
